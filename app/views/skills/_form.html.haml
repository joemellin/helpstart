    %p How to Create a Help Package
    %p So the idea for a help package is that it is something that it is based on your unique talents, knowledge and skill set.  And it is something that, if a startup were to get it, it would really benefit them.
    %p The other thing to remember is that you will not be doing this for every startup.  Startups will apply to you and only if you are really excited about them that most people decided to help the startup. 
    %p So what this means is it is best to make a great help package and then only help the startups that really are exciting to you.
